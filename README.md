# TestSEProject

The project is an innovative productivity application designed to streamline and simplify work for employees in a company. This application unifies all a company's work web-services into a single, user-friendly platform, eliminating the need for employees to constantly switch between different applications and programs.
In addition to the integration of work web-services, the application also offers a range of other features designed to enhance productivity and organization. Users can access to-do lists and can manage their different agendas.
